# We have lots of ADDINCLs to contrib/libs/libiconv all around the repo
# so we need to add it to sysincl for consistent resolving.
# We can go the other way here and remove iconv.h from all sysincl configs
# and try to fix all places where we really need iconv.h from libc
# Btw: seems that this ADDINCL should be made global and removed from projects
# that use this header

    - iconv.h:       contrib/libs/libiconv/iconv.h

# libunistring has its own libc header wrappers that are added to ADDINCL and
# need to be added here for consistensy between ADDINCL and sysincl resolving.
# Btw: we don't parse include_next, so we might lose real dependency to musl,
# but sysincl resolving will save us here, as it will resolve to both of them.
