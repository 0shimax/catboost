# Tutorials

## Python tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * __catboost\_python\_tutorial.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows some base cases of using catboost, such as model training, cross-validation and predicting, as well as some usefull features like early stopping,  snapshot support, feature importances and parameters tuning.

* CatBoost performance at different competitions:
    * __advanced\_tutorials/kaggle\_paribas.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows how to get to a 9th place on paribas competition with only few lines of code and training a CatBoost model.

    * __advanced\_tutorials/mlbootcamp\_v\_tutorial.ipynb__
        * This is an actual 7th place solution by Mikhail Pershin. Solution is very simple and is based on CatBoost.

* CatBoost and TensorFlow:
    * __advanced\_tutorials/quora\_catboost\_w2v.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows how to use CatBoost together with TensorFlow if you have text as input data.

* CatBoost and CoreML:
    * __advanced\_tutorials/catboost\_coreml\_export\_tutorial.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows how to convert CatBoost model to CoreML format and use it on an iPhone.

## R tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * __catboost\_r\_tutorial.ipynb__
        * This tutorial shows how to convert your data to CatBoost Pool, how to train a model and how to make cross validation and parameter tunning.

## Command line tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * __catboost\_cmdline\_tutorial.md__
        * This tutorial shows how to train and apply model with the command line tool.

## Custom loss tutorial

* Adding custom per-object error function tutorial:
    * __advanced\_tutorials/catboost\_custom\_loss\_tutorial.md__
        * This tutorial shows how to add custom per-object error function.
