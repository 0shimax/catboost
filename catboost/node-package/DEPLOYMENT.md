# Package build & deployment procedure

## Build scripts

Scripts responsible for building and preparing the package for publishing are located in `/build_scripts` directory. 

These scripts are built once on the first execution of any script.  To compile build scripts explicitly, run
```
npm run compile_build_scripts
```
